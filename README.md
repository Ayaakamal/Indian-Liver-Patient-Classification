# Indian Liver Patient Classification

This project focuses on classifying liver patients using machine learning models based on clinical data. The objective is to build an accurate model that can help in the early detection and diagnosis of liver diseases.

## Dataset

The dataset contains clinical data of patients, including features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Total Bilirubin
- Alkaline Phosphatase
- Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
- Total Proteins
- Albumin

Each record is classified as either a liver patient or a non-liver patient based on these features.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by filling with column means.
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender) using label encoding.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of key features.
- Examined correlations between clinical indicators to understand their relationships.

### 3. Model Building
Several machine learning algorithms were used, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation was applied to prevent overfitting.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/liver-patient-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script to train the model:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook indian_liver_patient_classification.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The best performing model achieved an accuracy of `X%` (replace with actual value), providing a reliable means of classifying liver patients.
